# CareerSignal (Agentic) — Project Plan Next

## Status: Deprecated and Superseded

This file previously described a continuous source-cache direction (blessed sources, background scraping, and job cache tables). That direction is now deprecated.

The active product direction is:

- Application Assistant only
- Single user-provided URL per run
- Single-user local-first
- No bulk or scheduled source scraping
- No continuous source cache pipeline

## Canonical Planning Documents

Use these as the source of truth:

- `miscellaneous/plan.md`
- `miscellaneous/project_scope.md`
- `.cursor/plans/application-assistant-v1-rebuild_daadf184.plan.md`

## Migration Note

Any future planning must align with the single-URL Application Assistant runtime and phase plan in `.cursor/plans/application-assistant-v1-rebuild_daadf184.plan.md`.
